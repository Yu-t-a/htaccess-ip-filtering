# htaccess-ip-filtering

This project demonstrates how to use Apache's `.htaccess` file with mod_rewrite to control access to your website based on IP address and referer.

### Features:
- **IP-based Access Control**: Restrict access to specific IP addresses (e.g., only allowing localhost).
- **Referer-based Filtering**: Ensure that traffic is coming from a trusted domain (e.g., only allow requests from `Domain`).
- **Custom 403 Page**: Redirect unauthorized users to a custom 403 Forbidden page.

---

## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**: 
    - Apache server with `mod_rewrite` enabled.
    - Access to the `.htaccess` file of your website or directory.

2. **How to Use**:
    - Place the following code in your `.htaccess` file in the root directory of your website:

    ```apache
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On

        # Allow localhost
        RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^127\.0\.0\.1$
        
        # Allow traffic from Domain
        # RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(www\.)?example\.go\.th [NC]
        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(www\.)?example\.com [NC]


        # Redirect all other requests to 403.html
        RewriteRule ^.*$ /403.html [L]
    </IfModule>
    ```

    - This configuration will:
        - Allow access from the localhost (`127.0.0.1`).
        - Allow requests originating from `Domain`.
        - Redirect all other unauthorized requests to a custom `403.html` page.

3. **Customizing the 403 Page**:
    - Create a `403.html` page that will be shown when access is denied.
    - You can place this file in the root directory or wherever you prefer.

# .htaccess Rewrite Rules for Access Control

This `.htaccess` file is used to configure Apache's URL rewriting rules for basic access control, focusing on:

- **Bypassing restrictions for specific file types**
- **Blocking external access except from a specific domain or localhost**

## üîß Configuration Summary

### 1. Enable `mod_rewrite`

The `mod_rewrite` module is activated to allow URL rewriting rules.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
```

---

### 2. Allow Access for Specific File Types

Requests to files with the following extensions are **allowed without restriction**:

- `.pdf`, `.PDF`
- `.png`
- `.jpg`

```apache
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(pdf|PDF|png|jpg)$ [NC]
RewriteRule ^ - [L]
```

---

### 3. Block All Other Requests Except for:

- Requests from IP `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
- Requests with a `Referer` from `example.go.th`

If the request fails both conditions, the user is redirected to a `403.html` page.

```apache
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^127\.0\.0\.1$
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(www\.)?example\.go\.th [NC]
RewriteRule ^.*$ /403.html [L]
```
```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.(pdf|PDF|png|jpg)$ [NC]
    RewriteRule ^ - [L]

    RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} !^127\.0\.0\.1$
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https?://(www\.)?example\.go\.th [NC]
    RewriteRule ^.*$ /403.html [L]
</IfModule>
```
---

## üìÅ File Required

Make sure `403.html` exists in your root directory to show the access denied message.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Use Cases

- Protecting internal resources from being accessed by unauthorized sources.
- Allowing PDF/image downloads while blocking web crawlers or hotlinks.
- Securing a government or organization portal (`example.go.th` in this case).

## Benefits:
- **Improved Security**: Only allows traffic from trusted sources and blocks unauthorized access.
- **Prevent Hotlinking**: Restricts access to prevent unwanted traffic or hotlinking from other websites.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust the allowed IP addresses and referer domains based on your needs.
